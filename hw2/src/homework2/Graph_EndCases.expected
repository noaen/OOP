# Sample Testing file

# Create a graph
created graph graph1
created graph graph2

# Create nodes
created node n1 with cost 5
created node n2 with cost 5
# Add nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge from n1 to n2 in graph1

# getNodes
graph1 contains: n1 n2
graph2 contains:

# getChildren
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2
the children of n2 in graph1 are:

# Add an edge
added edge from n1 to n1 in graph1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1 n2

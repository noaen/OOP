/**
 * A WalkingDirections class knows how to create a textual description of
 * directions from one location to another suitable for a pedestrian.
 * <p>
 * Calling <tt>computeDirections</tt> should produce directions in the following
 * form:
 * <p>
 * <tt>
 * Turn slight right onto Hankin Road and walk for 2 minutes.<br>
 * Turn slight right onto Trumpeldor Avenue and walk for 15 minutes.<br>
 * Turn left onto Hagalil and walk for 27 minutes.<br>
 * Turn sharp left onto Hanita and walk for 27 minutes.<br>
 * </tt>
 * <p>
 * Each line should correspond to a single geographic feature of the route. In
 * the first line, "Hankin Road" is the name of the first geographic feature of
 * the route, and "2 minutes" is the length of time that it would take to walk
 * along the geographic feature, assuming a walking speed of 20 minutes per
 * kilometer. The time in minutes should be reported to the nearest minute. Each
 * line should be terminated by a newline and should include no extra spaces
 * other than those shown above.
